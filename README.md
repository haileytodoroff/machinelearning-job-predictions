COMS4701 Artificial Intelligence - hw7 kaggle competition and pset

This project is built in Python and trains Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting ML models to predict the job performance of 20,000 potential candidates.

It implements feature selection on 300+ features, converts categorical fields to numerical, and considers potential algorithmic biases in final the prediction.

The results were submitted to a Kaggle competition, which scored over 91% accuracy.
